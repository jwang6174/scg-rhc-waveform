01) This experiment did not include segment information for post-hoc analysis 
(eg, determining if certain patients had lower accuracy, if particular 
segments corresponding to specific cardiac chambers had lower accuracy, etc). It
tries to replicate the original 'best' model published by Meng et al (2024).
Later realized that the waveforms were not segmented by cardiac chamber (ie,
the model was attempting to predict RA, RV, and PA waveforms). 

02) Tried to specifically predict PA waveforms. Implemented a smaller batch size 
of 16, compared to the batch size of 128 used in the original paper, on a hunch 
that it may provide better predictions. Later realized that SCG and RHC
waveforms were being min-max normalized, but only with respect to individual
segemnts. Consider whether absolute values may lead to better results.

03) Same parameters as project 2 except using absolute values for SCG and RHC
waveforms. Note that in the future if using relative values, would have to
account for the maximum values of all segments in both training and test sets.
This experiment was aborted early due to large, unstable gradients.

04) Same parameters as project 2 except using correctly minmax normalized values
across the entire dataset with respect to separate SCG and RHC channels, ignored 
segments containing negative RHC values, and used batch size of 4.

05) Same parameters as project 4 except returned to using batch size of 128 and
lambda_aux of 500 instead of 100.

06) Return to using minmax normalization relative to each segment rather than
across all segments. Return to using lambda_aux of 100 and batch_size of 64.  Use 
all SCG channels (patch_ACC_lat, patch_ACC_hf, and patch_ACC_dv) for PA waveforms.
